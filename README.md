# Hi there, I'm Yash Bohra üëã

I'm a **Frontend Engineer** with 1+ year of hands-on experience building fast, responsive, and scalable web applications at a product-based startup (**Zintlr**). I specialize in crafting sleek UIs with **React**, **Redux**, and **JavaScript**, and have a strong focus on performance, reusability, and real-world product impact.

From building modular component libraries to integrating APIs and managing complex state with Redux, I‚Äôve contributed to smoother user experiences and faster feature rollouts in a collaborative environment. I take pride in delivering interfaces that are not only clean and intuitive but also scalable and efficient.

What drives me is **product thinking**, clean UI/UX, and continuous learning. I‚Äôm currently diving deeper into **backend development** with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **SQL** to grow as a full-stack developer and contribute across the stack.
